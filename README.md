# CS130-Operating-System

The [pintos project](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring20/pintos/pintos_2.html#SEC15) used for ShanghaiTech CS130 Operating System.

This is the result of teamwork with my friend Yining She, and it takes lots of time, mostly worth it. This repository is able to pass all the test cases using QEMU as simulator, BUT DO NOT USE IT FOR YOUR COURSE WORK DIRECTLY !!!
